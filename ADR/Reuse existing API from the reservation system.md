**Title:**

Reuse the existing API's from the agency reservation system

**Context:** 

As the agency builds new portal for various features, building / using an API -first approach is crtical to build headless app's as it gives 
flexibility for the agency to build additional portals. 

**Decision:**

We made a decision to reuse the exisitng reservation API's so that it provides seemless experience to the agnecy's reservation and agency trip management 
system and allows customer to have more reliable information as the data comes from the same source of truth using API's 

**Status:** 

Approved by all the parties involved (Architects, business owners, product owners, Development team) 

**Consequences:**

Any changes in the API may have adverse impact to the consumers in this case agency trip management and reservation portal. But the versioning should mitigate
impact
